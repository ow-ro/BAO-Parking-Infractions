# BAO Parking Infractions
**_Android: Creating & managing parking tickets and exceptions for Base Area Operations at Whistler Blackcomb_**

The BAO Parking Infractions app manages the ticketing aspect of the parking lots for Whistler Blackcomb, North America's largest ski resort. Tickets can be created, managed and removed in the app. Exceptions, for example when a Snowmaker can park overnight, can also be created & removed to prevent authorised vehicles without visible permits from being ticketed. Additional protected admin functionality exists for the Leadership team to perform elevated tasks not permitted by the user: viewing the deletion log, backing up the database, etc.
